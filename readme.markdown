Usage
=====
To use JSON, simply compile the core project as a library and set the resulting DLL as a reference in your project. 
Alternatively, import the project files directly into your project.

Architecture
============
JSON is a JavaScript Object Notation library, capable of reading and writing files and strings, as well as verifying 
files and strings against predefined schemas. The library uses a very small number of objects to accomplish this, 
making it simple and easy to use.

JSON uses a very simple LL(1) approach to parsing files and strings. The following sections cover the various phases 
of parsing.

###Lexer
The first step breaks the input string into descrete pieces, through a process known as lexical analysis. These 
descrete pieces are called tokens, and are used to check for syntactic correctness in the next step.

###Parser
Once the code has been broken into tokens, the token ordering is used to determine if the code's syntax is correct. 
This is known as syntactic analysis. During this step the tokens are placed into a JSON root object, called the JSON 
document. This document object can then be accessed by a user to request any number of nested tags.

###Document

###Schemas

Syntax
======
Compared to other human-readable languages, such as XML, JSON is exceedingly simple and easy to use. 
The following sections briefly covers the various tag types and associated syntax used by JSON.

###JSON Objects

###JSON Syntax
Listed below is the Backusâ€“Naur Form (BNF) used by JSON.

```
JSON_DOC ::= <object>

array ::= [ ] | [ <pair_list> ]

object ::= { } | { <pair_list> }

pair ::= <key> : <value>

pair_list ::= <pair> | <pair> , <pair_list>

value ::= <array> | <boolean> | <number> | <object> | <string>
```

Examples
========
Listed below are a series of examples showing how to use various JSON library features.
